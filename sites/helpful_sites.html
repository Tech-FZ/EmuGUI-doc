        <p>
            EmuGUI relies on other resources, too, because nobody knows everything.
            Also, we can't cover everything. Here are some helpful sites to help you.

                    One of my recommendations if you want to get to know about how your favourite
                    version of Windows came to be, but other operating systems (and also virtualization
                    software and other applications) are covered here as well.

                    Basically it's BetaWiki, but it also covers gaming consoles. Also, you can get
                    some information here what you can't get in BetaWiki.
