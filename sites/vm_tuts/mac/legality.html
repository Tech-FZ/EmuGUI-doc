        <h2 class="heading">The legal side of macOS on EmuGUI</h2>

        <p>
            Yes, EmuGUI has got the ability to emulate some older versions of
            macOS. However, due to the license agreement which prohibits you
            from installing this system on non-Apple machines and some
            countries ignoring this by law, here is an article to help you.
        </p>

        <h3 class="secondaryheading">Disclaimer</h3>

            <li>
                I'm not a lawyer. If you are at all unsure, please
                get help from a real lawyer. This article comes
                with absolutely no warranty.

                I can't list every country. Please check your
                local copyright laws.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="secondaryheading">The obvious: Apple's EULA</h3>

        <p>
            First, we look at the End User License Agreement (EULA) from Apple
            themselves. According to the EULA of macOS 12 Monterey (Last visit
            on 15th June, 2022), you're only allowed to use it on Apple-branded
            systems. You can view the EULA
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/macOSMonterey.pdf">
                here.
            </a> However, some copyright laws don't incorporate that and
            that's where we're going to look next.
        </p>

        <h3 class="secondaryheading">The US copyright laws</h3>

        <p>
            Note: I could only do possibly inaccurate research
            but at least I got some results.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, we look at what the USA (where Apple is from) has to
            say. According to my research, it is in the most part illegal
            to install macOS on non-Apple hardware via DMCA. However, some
            say if you have got a real Mac, installing macOS on your...
            let's say Lenovo machine would fall under Fair Use, meaning
            this operation would fall under the gray area.
        </p>

        <p>
            Do you know more about this? Please let me know!
        </p>

        <h3 class="secondaryheading">The German copyright laws</h3>

        <p>
            Note: In Germany, I was able to find out more (I'm German)
            and can tell you a bit more clearly. However, this
            might still get too inaccurate. Please consult a
            lawyer if you are at all unsure.
        </p>

        <p>
            The German copyright laws are possibly less strict than the
            US-American DMCA. The Germans do prohibit piracy but the macOS
            case is unclear. Let's say, as some German tech sites like GIGA or
            PC-Welt could write an article about installing macOS on VirtualBox
            on a Windows machine without getting in trouble with Apple, I
            assume this falls under gray area.
