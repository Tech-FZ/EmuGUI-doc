            Note: I am not a lawyer but I do know that it violates the End User License
            Agreement (EULA) from Apple. However, some German tech magazines like GIGA
            or PC-WELT (Yes, I'm German) wrote articles on how to install macOS on
            VirtualBox on a Windows machine and therefore I can say that Apple can't
            enforce that. A article about this situation is
